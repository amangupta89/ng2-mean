MEAN stack using Angular 2

## Getting Started
To get started, run `npm install`, `bower install`, and then in your terminal run `gulp serve`. Then open another terminal window and run `npm start`. 

`http://localhost:3000` is the server returning the index file, and `http://localhost:8080` is the landing for the Angular 2 app.

I'm working on trying to get everything to run on one server, like I have in other MEAN stack apps, but not sure where to go from here. Any help is appreciated.
